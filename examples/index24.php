<h2>I've hit a roadblock</h2>
<p>My form is working great. It's filtering responses, throwing errors 
when responses are in the wrong format, etc., and redirecting users here if 
everything is correct. Great!</>
<p>Now I'm ready to set up my database, but I apparently don't have admin 
rights on my own computer. Go figure. These are the times I could use a 
mentor, a tutor ... someone who knows PHP? It's not really a PHP error, though. 
I've tried a couple of solutions but I'm tired &mdash; and tired of looking. 
Errors are best solved with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>Until I get the database working, click the Add Pizza button and try my 
form out. It's pretty cool.</p>
